Hai, My name is Saleh Hasan Badjrie.

In this time, i want to show my project when i was at 6th semester making an app called RentalMobil. it is basically an application to order some mechanic if the consument have a problem with their car or motorcycle. it's app not 100% work perfectly, just 60% because it's still so much bug and button didn't have a function. But i got experience building this app to learning more to new people about their app and want to continue this app to run perfectly. Thank you
