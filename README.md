Hai, My name is Saleh Hasan Badjrie.

In this time, i want to show my project when i was at 6th semester making an app called RentalMobil. it is basically an application to order some mechanic if the customer have a problem with their car or motorcycle. it's app not 100% work perfectly in Adobe XD, just 60% because it's still so much bug and button didn't have a function. RentalMobil actually I made it first with Adobe XD to create plot to one layer to another layer. It is still base on Adobe XD and just take 20% in order to make to become actually Android Application.
